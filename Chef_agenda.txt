Priority wise issue pickup
Two lists mostly we concentrate as a priority
1. https://github.com/chef/customer-bugs/issues


2. https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/sustaining-engineering-5e4e001e33a6285468d9eb87/board?repos=108278,3720567

Our primary project repo is Chef

https://github.com/chef/chef

Our main issues/bugs come from this repo

So there are 3 parts on working the issue :

Analysis
Recreate
Apply Fix and push the code

In Analysis we mostly need to identify the environment/chef version & platform issue is related to.

In recreate/reproduce there are certain ways
A)
1. Create VM from Cloud(AWS/Azure)
2. Setup chef there with the same version what is mentioned in the issue/bug

   You can refer/consider https://github.com/chef/chef-workstation/issues/1167#issuecomment-627407517 while setting up your environment

3. Create recipe/cookbook and try to reproduce with chef-apply <recipe.rb>
B) Using kitchen
 1. Go to cd kitchen-test
 2. Update kitchen.yml
 3. Create your recipe file under kitchen-test/cookbooks/end_to_end/recipes
 4. kitchen create and kitchen converge

In Applying fix Part

1. You need to clone the forked repo i.e. https://github.com/msystechnologiesllc/chef
2. Debug the code using pry/buybug to identify the area which is causing the bug
3. Implement/Apply fix
4. Create PR by pushing the code
