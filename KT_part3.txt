Answers.

What is Test Kitchen?

It is chef's integrated testing framework. It is used to automatically test cookbooks across any combination of platforms and test suites.


Purpose of the Test Kitchen?
It enables writing test recipes , which will run on the VMs once they are instantiated and converged using the cookbook. The test recipes run on that VM and can verify if everything works as expected. Concepts related are platform, suite, instance, driver and provisioner.



How to use it ?
-> Test suites are defined in kitchen.yml. See the configuration documentation for options and syntax information
-> Supports cookbooks testing across many cloud providers and virtualization technologies.
-> Uses a comprehensive set of operating system base images from chef's Bento project.



What is PolicyFiles?

It is a way to manage role, environment and community cookbook data with a single document that is uploaded to the Chef infra server. It makes it easier to test and promote code safely with a simple interface. Improves the user experience and resolves real world problems that some workflows built around Chef Infra.


How to use policyfiles?
-> Focus on the workflow of the entire system
-> Safe development workflows
-> Less expensive computation
-> Code visibility
-> Role mutability
-> Cookbook mutability
-> Replaces Berkshlef and the environment
