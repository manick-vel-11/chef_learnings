#1 Workstation

Chef workstation packages all the tools necessary to be successful with Chef Infra and Chef InSpec. These tools are combined into packages for common operating systems and include all the dependencies needed to get started.

Tools in chef workstation includes
-> Chef CLI
-> knife
-> Chef Infra Client
-> Chef Habitat
-> Chef InSpec
-> Cookstyle
-> Test Kitchen

It provides remote execution, remote scanning,configuration tasks, cookbook creation tools as well as robust dependency and testing software


#2 Node

A node is any physical, virtual or cloud device that is configured and maintained by an instance of Chef infra Client.
Nodes use Chef infra client to ask the Chef Infra server for configuration details such as recipes, templates and file distributions.


#3 Chef server
Chef server acts as a hub for configuration data. The chef infra server stores cookbooks, the policies that are applied to the nodes and metadata that describes each registered node that is being managed by chef infra client

Chef Infra server components
-> Clients
-> Load Balancer
-> Chef Manage
-> Chef Infra Server
-> Bookshelf
-> Messages
-> PostgreSQL


#4 How to bootstrap a node

Boostrapping installs Chef Infra Client on a target system so that it runs as a client and sets the node up to communicate with Chef Infra Server.

Ways to bootstrap a node
-> Run the knife bootstrap command from a workstation
-> Perform a unattended install to bootstrap from the node itself, without requiring SSH or WinRM connectivity

stages of bootstrap operation
-> knife boostrap
-> Get install script from Chef Infra
-> Get package from Chef Infra
-> Install the chef client
-> Start the chef-client run
-> Complete the chef-client run

#5 Use of running chef infra client periodically

-> Registering and authenticating the node with Chef Infra Server
-> Synchronizing cookbooks from the Chef Infra Server to the nod
-> Compiling the resource collection by loading each of the required cookbooks, including recipes, attributes and all other dependencies
-> Taking the appropriate and required actions to configure the nodes based on recipes and attributes
-> Reporting summary information on the run to Chef Automate

#6 Cookbook

A cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution. A cookbook defines a scenario and contains everything that is required to support that scenario

-> Recipes that specify the resources to use and the order in which they are to be applied
-> Attribute values
-> File distributions
-> Templates
-> Extensions to Chef, such as custom resources and libraries

Components of cookbook
-> Recipes
-> Files
-> Attributes
-> Libraries
-> Custom resources
-> Templates
-> Ohai Plugins
-> Metadata


#7 Upload a cookbook to Chef infra server
It can be done using knife upload command

knife cookbook upload cookbook_name

#8 Update a existing cookbook
knife cookbook upload cookbook_name --force
