1) Go through this Docs https://docs.chef.io/cookbooks/ and understand each and every component of it
2) Use cron resource and setup a cronjob which will create the file in your home path and make an entry of current time into it. This file should get updated after every 15 min using cron job.

Once you are done with #2 create the gist of your recipe and share with us.
Also include Chef commands that you explored while running these recipes.

3) Understand how to write custom resources and standards followed by Chef to write Custom resources.

4) Explore the Cron resource code by cloning https://github.com/chef/chef
Run bundle install command into it
Check how to use Chef zero to run cookbooks locally
1) Doc to refer https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef_client/#about-chef-zero
2) Also you can use chef-client -z options to run the recipes on --local-mode (
Using bundle exec <and your chef-client command> will run the current code which is there is the repo (Ruby way to execute current code in library)

Add debugger in the cron resource and explore the code. Understand as much as you can (This is just to give you glimpse of how resources work in Chef)

Answers

1. Got familiar with cookbook components. Read through each of them
-> Recipes
-> Attributes
-> Files
-> Libraries
-> Custom Resources
-> Templates
-> Ohai Plugins
-> Metadata

2. Followed the below steps to achieve this

-> Updated the cron job in my system using crontab command
# m h  dom mon dow   command
*/15 * * * * /bin/sh /home/ad.msystechnologies.com/mkumaravel/git/chef_learnings/cron_cookbook_sample/recipes/sample1.sh

-> Made chef-client to run in sample.sh file which will pickup the file_resource.rb and run its content
-> Made current time to display in the file_resource.rb file
-> Current time will get displayed every 15 minutes when cronjob runs

It got familiar with chef commands like chef-client, chef-zero etc. Also, test kitchen as well

3. Worked on creating custom resources and learnt about creating and modifying custom resources.

4. Got exposure to chef repo and had a chance to come across kitchen interface, chef-client -z command.
